# My dotfiles
My config with a simple installation script.
Works on MacOS and Arch Linux.
Should be easily portable to all Linux distros (and maybe BSDs).

Focused on zsh, tmux and vim.
Comes with features like zsh syntax coloring, autosuggestion, vim autocompletion
with many LSP options, nice tmux bindings, theming, fzf integration and much
more.
Crafted to make terminal apps use 16 ANSI colors, so the theme stays consistent
and is easy to modify from one place.
Includes some minimalist xorg programs and config.

On Linux it is best to use the dotfiles with my 
[suckless builds](https://github.com/maciejzj/suckless-builds).
